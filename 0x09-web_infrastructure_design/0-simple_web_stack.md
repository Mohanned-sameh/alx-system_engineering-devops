Infrastructure Components:

Server: A physical or virtual machine with necessary resources to host the web infrastructure.
Domain Name: foobar.com is a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8). It's configured with a 'www' record to ensure access via www.foobar.com.

Web Server (Nginx): Acts as the front-facing server handling incoming HTTP requests. It receives requests from users' browsers and forwards them to the application server.

Application Server: Runs the application code (e.g., written in PHP, Python, etc.). It processes requests received from the web server, generates dynamic content, and sends it back to the web server for delivery to users.
Application Files: The codebase and associated files of the website's application, containing the logic and functionality.

Database (MySQL): Stores and manages the website's data. It's accessed by the application server to perform read and write operations.

Role Explanation:

Server: A server is a computer system that provides services or resources to other computers (in this case, hosting the website).

Domain Name: It's a human-readable alias for the server's IP address, making it easier for users to access websites without needing to remember IP addresses.

www DNS Record: It's a subdomain record specifying the web prefix for the domain (www.foobar.com) to direct traffic to the web server.

Web Server: Acts as an intermediary between user requests and the application server, handling static content, and routing requests to the appropriate resources.

Application Server: Executes the website's logic, generates dynamic content, interacts with the database, and sends processed data back to the web server.

Database: Stores and manages the website's data, allowing the application to retrieve, store, and modify information.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If any component (server, web server, application server, or database) fails, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during Maintenance: When updates or maintenance are required, the website might experience downtime, especially when restarting the web server after deploying new code.

Scalability Limitations: As the entire infrastructure relies on a single server, it can't efficiently handle a significant increase in incoming traffic. Scaling options like load balancing and horizontal scaling are not feasible without additional servers.
